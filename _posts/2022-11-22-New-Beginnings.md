Hello Reader,

Welcome to my first blog post. My name is Joshua, but for this blog, I am TheJooosh. 

I've worked primarily in System Administration and End User Support for about 5 years. A passion has been brewing, a passion that leads us all to Github. Programming. I've begun with Javascript & Powershell. I am not what you would call a book leaner... I spend most of my times in labs and play areas. 

Historically I've written complex use-specific Powershell applications and before that I dabbled in NodeJS. 

My hope is to use this platform as a means to share my experience, thoughts, and projects.

This page will definitely change. For now, this is what you get. 

Thanks for checking out my first post!

TheJooosh.
