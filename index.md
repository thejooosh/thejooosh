Starting a blog towards the end of 2022 feels as if I'm getting on this train a little late. Whatever, I have things I want to share. This blog, while it may eventually turn out to be a good source of information, is new. Not only is the blog new, so am I. I've been in my career for close to 5 years now. I'm becoming more serious about the content I'm looking to push publically. 

This blog may become something, or it may not. 

Only time will tell, and I'm happy to have you here experiencing it with me.

Thanks,
Josh
